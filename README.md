# Atlas One
Simple gest detection using gyroscopes and Arduino. It's a little hobby project I worked on in high school. All info about the code can be found in the code commentary.

# Hardware
I used Arduino Pro Mini 3.3V 8MHz mainly because I worried that any 5V board could have problems with communicating with 3.3V MPUs. Turns out you can use any board you like, the PCB in this repo is designed specifically for said Pro Mini tho. You can find an assembled device photo in this repo.

There's also a pdf with another pcb design for diy pcb. If you want to etch your own pcb in your basement this is the file you're looking for, just print it on a laser printer (ink won't work), etch and connect the two pairs of holes with some wiring.

Be sure to hit me up if you need some more detailed info about this project or have any ideas regarding further development.
